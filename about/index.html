      <p>Hello! I am Eddie Dale &#x1f44b;</p><p>This is my personal website and blog.</p><p><strong>My background</strong></p><p>I am born in Oslo, Norway. I studied for 3 years in Perth, Australia doing a bachelors degree in Interactive Media Development. After that I went back to Oslo for some years, before ending up in Hannover, Germany for the last 6 years. Here I live with my wife and 3 kids.</p><p><strong>What I do</strong></p><p>I run a little web agency in Lillestrøm, Norway together with my colleague <a href="https://www.stafto.com">Stig Taftø</a>. It is called <a href="https://www.vasser.no">Vasser</a>, and is a development agency that focusses on content driven web pages for small to medium scale businesses. We work largely with Craft CMS, as we believe that this is the best suited CMS for that particular task.</p><p><strong>Hobbies</strong></p><p>I was born into a house of musicians, and I've been playing guitar since I was a kid. I also love to be active, either going for runs or lifting weights.</p>
