He has always been a great inspiration when it comes to honestly sharing his work. I keep going back to his blog, because so much of the writing he does resonate with me. Not long ago he also made a <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2023/08/20/how-do-i-save-links-for-later/">convincing argument about using a blog as the "ultimate long term storage of ideas, bookmarks, tools and inspiration</a>. I really like that idea.</p><p>I've been here many times before, and I might well not be able to follow through on this, but here's to trying!</p>
