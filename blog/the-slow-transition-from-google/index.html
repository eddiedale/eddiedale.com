      <p>This year I have decided to make the leap, and transition from my trusty Gmail account. I have long considered to, but the task felt so huge that I always pushed it aside.</p><p>I was a user of gmail since the early beta-stages. For a long time I was even a huge proponent of it. Suggested it to friends and family as a great alternative to hotmail, gmx, outlook and the likes. At the time it was a big plus for me that it was «free», and I had absolutely no interest in paying money when a free option was available.</p><p>Fast forward 20 years, and I still have that «free» gmail account. Except this time I know the greater picture of that free-business model. I know that I’ve basically given insight to my whole digital mailbox the last 2 decades, and it starts to bother me looking back.</p><p>I no longer look at free products as being actually free, but consider what lies within the free-model. Maybe its just me getting older too, but I can’t help but feel much more inclined to use products that are fairly priced in an understandable way – rather than free products that I either don’t understand how makes money, or don’t like how makes money.</p><p>Which is why I’m now here. This is my new home for my emails. Hey perfectly answers all my wishes for what an email service should be.</p><p>It will take time. I know that. I will still depend on gmail for a while longer. But the transition has started.</p><p>Take ownership of your digital life. And don’t keep all your digital services with one company!</p><p>– Eddie</p>
