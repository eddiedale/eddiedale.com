    <p class="mt-4 text-sm">20.Sep 2023 – Eddie Dale</p>

    <main class="mt-8 prose prose-invert pb-64">
      <p>I mainly work with Craft CMS sites currently, and I made the switch from Laravel Valet to DDEV as per their suggestions last year.</p><p>Generally there is much to like about DDEV, especially the aspect of having different versions of PHP per project is a bit easier to maintain than it was in Laravel Valet, and to have this config directly in the project files. </p><p>But I sure do miss the simplicity that Valet had. Just drop a folder into the parked folder, and its instantly available at foldername.test in the browser.</p><p>Especially seeing my newfound fascination for the flat file CMS Kirby, I really miss being able to just drop the folder in the Valet directory and be up and running.</p><p>So, now I run both side by side. This is how I've done it:</p><p>I've made two separate coding folders: One for my DDEV projects (Craft CMS), and one for Valet; my new "lightweight" quick work directory.</p><p>To avoid port-issues I set up DDEV projects using a specific port:</p><p><strong>config.yaml:</strong><br />router_http_port: "8080"<br />router_https_port: "8443"</p><p>This somehow still didn't allow me to <strong>ddev start </strong>my projects initially, because it still squirmed about port 433 being in use. So it was needed to do a <strong>ddev poweroff </strong>before the <strong>ddev start</strong>.</p>
