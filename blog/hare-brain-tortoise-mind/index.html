      <p>I just finished a great little book from John Cleese called Creativity: A short and cheerful guide.<br /><br />In it, he talked about a book and idea from Guy Claxton, called "Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind" (Which now is on my reading list).<br /><br />The idea is that the "Hare Brain" involves 'figuring matters out, weighing up the pros and cons, constructing arguments and solving problems.' This is the classic problem-solving way of thinking relying on reason, logic and deliberate conscious thinking.<br /><br />The most interesting part however, was the idea of the Tortoise Mind, and of its importance on creative work. The Tortoise Mind 'proceeds more slowly … It is often less purposeful and clear cut, more playful, leisurely or dreamy. In this mode we are ruminating or mulling things over, being contemplative or meditative. We may be pondering a problem, rather than earnestly trying to solve it'.<br /><br />The crucial point being made is that this leisurely Tortoise Mind, for all its apparent aimlessness, is just as intelligent as the much faster 'Hare Brain'.<br /><br />'When we are not sure what needs to be taken into account, or even which questions to pose – or when the issue is too subtle to be captured by the familiar categories of conscious thought … we need recourse to the tortoise mind.'<br /><br />This also connects well together with something else I found very interesting, written by Billy Oppenheimer, regarding <a href="https://twitter.com/bpoppenheimer/status/1639281614013321216?lang=en">what the brain is doing when you are doing absolutely nothing</a>.<br /><br />The neuroscientist Dr. Nancy Andreasen did a study of brain activity when the brain is in a "resting state"—free of inputs/free to wander:<br /><strong>During REST, the brain "uses its most human &amp; complex parts."</strong><br />"We found activations in multiple regions of the association cortex," Dr. Andreasen wrote. "We were not [seeing] a passive silent brain during the ‘resting state,’ but rather a brain that was actively connecting thoughts and experiences.”<br /><br />Dr. Andreasen writes about the study in her book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Creating-Brain-Neuroscience-Genius-ebook/dp/B004P5NQ5M">The Creating Brain: The Neuroscience of Genius</a></p>
